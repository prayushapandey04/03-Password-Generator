# 03-Password-Generator

This is a password generator in which the computer gives a random password, based on the user's preferences.

## Description

This is a randomized computer password generator. By using HTML and CSS the page is styled and the content is added. I have built on the starter code I was given and have added functionality to the website by using JavaScript. This website asks a user a series of questions using a prompt window and generates a password based on their preferences. 

## Usage

As soon as a user enters this website, they will press the red "generate password" button and will be prompted with a series of questions in which they can press "OK" or "Cancel." They keep getting prompted to answer questions on if they would want any numbers in their password, any special characters, lower or upper case characters, etc. At the end, after they are done answering all the questions, they are given a computer randomized password in which they can use for their necessary accounts. Shown below are images of example questions the user is asked as well as an example of how the end result/password looks.
